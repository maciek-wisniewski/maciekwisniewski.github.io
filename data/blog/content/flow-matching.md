# Flow Matching for Scientific ML

Flow matching can simplify training dynamics in scientific generative models by learning transport maps directly.

## Why it helps

- Better stability on stiff distributions
- Competitive sample quality with simpler objectives

## Practical note

Focus on robust evaluation metrics and out-of-domain behavior, not only in-distribution benchmarks.
